              Gris Dior is the olfactory expression of gray, the iconic color of
              the House of Dior that embodies the bold spirit of Christian Dior.
            </p>
            <p>
              A unisex eau de parfum that defies gender, Gris Dior is an intense
              chypre fragrance that makes a strong, recognizable statement, a
              fragrance you adopt and interpret to suit your own rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gris Dior uninhibitedly combines heritage with a modern twist and
              plays the unisex card with confidence. It is multifaceted and not
              as obvious as it seems, like the color gray, richly nuanced with
              its subtleties, anything but a simple mix of black and white.
